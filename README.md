# **PM-AJAY Dashboard**

The **PM-AJAY Dashboard** is a unified digital platform for monitoring **Adarsh Gram**, **GIA**, and **Hostel** components. It streamlines agency coordination, tracks project progress, milestones, and fund flow, and enhances transparency, accountability, and real-time decision-making across States/UTs.

**PM-AJAY** aims for socio-economic empowerment of **Scheduled Castes (SCs)** through infrastructure, education, and community upliftment.

### **Funds**

* Lack of tracking often results in delays.

### **Challenges**
